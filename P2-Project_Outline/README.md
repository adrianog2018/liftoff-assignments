### Overview
ToyoBrowser is an application that collects all the information available by models and years as well as features available in each Toyota model. Its usefulness is that without being a specialist in the product you can determine how you would like your next car if you are in the market to buy a Toyota. In turn, it would also be useful to determine the customer's needs (color, features, etc.) from the vendor's point of view.
Today Jan 2019, I have been working as a BDC agent for Toyota dealers for 2 years and the idea of ToyoBrowser arises from the need to understand and have quick access to all the information related to Toyota models and to respond promptly to the customer. Although Toyota has some related applications these are a bit obsolete and limited. With ToyoBrowser you can not only search for models and submodels (Trims) but you can compare them or find which models have a specific feature.
### Features
-Search for models and submodels: the user will be able to search all the features between models and submodels.

-Search for specific features: the user will search for a feature and get a result list of models in which it is available.

-Compare between models and submodels: the user can determine the differences and similarities between two different models or between two different Trims of the same model (Corolla vs. Camry, Camry LE vs. Camry SE).

-In any case of search will not matter if it is written in capital letters or not.
